After analysing the data, few questions raised in my mind those are as follows:
Question: 1) How many male / female survived / died from the ship with respect to different Pclass (First class, Second class, third class)?
Question: 2) What is the percentage of survived / died passengers with respect to different age groups (child, teen, young, audult, oldsters), gender of passenger, passenger embarked station?
Question 3) What is the correlation between the number of surviors and fare with respect to same Age_Group and Station?

In order to do the analysis of the data I have used Pie charts, Bar charts, Stack bar charts, etc.
